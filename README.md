# A chat application with gRPC

This project is a simple implementation of a chat server using gRPC.

## Overview

gRPC is a high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework. It can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking, and authentication. In this project, we utilize gRPC to implement a simple chat server.

## Demo

Check out this short demo to see the test of the chat server in action using BloomRPC:

## Usage

1. Connect to the chat server using a gRPC client
2. Use the `chat` method to send messages to other users
3. Use the `exit` method to disconnect from the server
